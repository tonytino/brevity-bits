# Interview Prep Cheat Sheet (Presented by Patrick Reynolds)

## Pre-Interview

### Ask for the interviewer(s) information

- Get details like:

    - Who you're interviewing with

    - What team/department

    - What languages will I be tested on

    - What's the contact information of the hiring manager

    - How many people will I interview with

    - Look up more stuff to find out about

### Research the company (GitHub, LinkedIn, Blogs, Twitter, Glassdoor, CrunchBase, Website, News)

- Should be relative to how far along you are in the interview process (the further you are, the more you should know)

- **If they just got funding (check CrunchBase), APPLY!**

### Reach out to current employees

- They don't have to be on the team you're applying for (ex. Marketing)

- Talk about whatever (check out their blog/twitter to see what they're interested in, and bring it up, whether its personal or technical topics)

### Be honest with your interests

- If you have plenty of runway before you NEED a job, don't lie about what you want to do (ex. don't say you want to do back-end)

- If you don't have a lot of time, it may be okay to bite the bullet and learn things you think you might not be as interested in

- It's better to take less and do what you want to do.

### Standard interview time cycle

- First, they check if you're sane (phone interview)

- Second is the remote technical interview

### Alogrithms vs *algorithms*

- Don't focus on hardcore algorithms (ex. that Stanford course, i.e. academic algorithms)

- Focus on real-world algorithms, stuff that you'd actually use. Basically, know how to approach and break down a problem.

- It's good to be aware of things that exist (like merge sort), but you don't have to know everything about it top to bottom. Same idea as knowing the methods available in ruby docs. Maybe take the time to look up important algorithms that exist.

### Get comfortable with the interview details

- Remote: Google Docs, text editor, quiet space, working headphones, quick reference notes

- Onsite: Organized notes (yes, you can have basic notes, just ask if it's okay to use them), workspace, interview format (ask them how they structure it)

### Practice relevant problems to their business

- **Know the technologies that are driving their core business!!!**

- Be familiar with techniques they use

- Sometimes questions they ask might be way too difficult for you to answer (because they've been working on it for months). The purpose is to see how you would approach it and how you would've tried contributing, even if that means how you would've researched it. *Distill down the smaller parts of the larger problem.*

### Focus on the fundamentals

- Be comfortable, confident, and fresh with JavaScript, Ruby, etc. Don't forget how to do this stuff because you focused on learning a bunch of new, flashy libraries.

## During Interview

- Have multiple questions ready that show your interest in the company and showcase your prior research. (Example: Find an old, or new, blog post by the company, think about it thoroughly and ask a genuine question about it)

- Be aware of the company's culture, team, environment, moral, attitude, etc. (Example: Would you want to spend 40-80 hours a week there. Are people happy? Nice set up?)

### Interview Question Approaches (order of best approaches):

- Brute force (just fucking solve it any way you can)

- Hashing (hash map, everything can be improved with hashes)

- Helper Methods (example: tell them you're "pretending" an unimportant method exists (i.e. that you'll make it later) for the sake of solving the real problem, like a #.pop method or a date converter)

- Greedy (not sure, something about using up resources like space)

- State maximum efficiency (state that you know that this can be solved with a Big O of n, but you can't think it through entirely and will do it a different way instead just so you can solve it)

### Interview Question Considerations:

- Time Complexity (how long will it take)

- Space Complexity (how much space is needed)

- Cleanliness (like your handwriting, maybe ask if you clean it up after solving)

### Additional:

- Make it a point to learn. Ask for feedback, like what could I had done better, was I on the right track, etc.

- Have fun!

- Breath and relax

## Post-Interview

- Reflect on what went well and what you can improve on. (What did you answer well and how did you answer it. What did they ask you about that you didn't answer well or know?)

- Possible follow up with solution you weren't confident with if that fits your style

- Follow up in a timely manner to keep the communication lines open

- Expect and be ready for varied decision timelines

- Don't burn bridges

- Keep applying to other companies

- Celebrate! (failures and successes)

**ALWAYS SEND A FOLLOW UP (short, simple thank you) THE SAME DAY OF THE INTERVIEW; SOMETIMES CAN BE DEAL-BREAKER.**

## Key Prep Areas:

- **Algorithms & Data Structures (these are fundamental topics)**, White Boarding (BIG!), Applications (as in applying to companies, networking, job search stuff), and Projects (keep working on them!).

## Reaching out

### LinkedIn Message

- "Hi Bob, my name is Anthony Hernandez, graduate of Dev Bootcamp and San Diego State University (Economics). I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities and I saw X position on X website and would like to connect with you to explore the opportunitiy. Thanks! -Anthony Hernandez"

- Don't be afraid to follow-up after a week.

- Give hiring managers/employees a week (max of two follow-ups, make sure to let them know that you don't mean to bother them and that it's the last time you'll be following up). Recruiters shouldn't take more than 2 days.


## Side Notes:

- You should always negotiate to some extent. Don't arm-bar them, just be honest (I got X offer from Y company, but would rather work for you without discounting myself).

- If it's a start-up and they can't afford to offer you a good rate, ask if they're willing to renegotiate 3/6 months later for a major raise (could be 30-40%!). Sometimes, they'll offer you equity instead.

- "T" Shaped developer/portfolio: (same idea as CFA vs MBA, be both!)

    - They have a good breadth (not all focused on just one thing)

    - They know the front-end and back-end, but are masters at one

    - Have a large number of skills, but be really strong in a couple (if you can master specific things, you could master anything)

- Skills section (resume)

    - Primary Focus: JavaScript, Ruby, etc.

    - Experience with: Foundation, HTML5, CSS3, etc.

    - Additional skills (stuff I've done once or twice, or are not as much of a hard skill, like project management):

# Outreach

- Check out the cold and warm outreach pdf for additional instructions.

*Remember that each message (the back and forth) you send lowers your chances of meeting someone. Be direct, cover all grounds, be brief (5-6 sentence message - comment on their company or their blog/tweet, introduce yourself, tell them you want to meet up for coffee (not an informational interview, it's easier to say yes to), suggest when to meet up, a call to action for them).* See the

## The Process

1. Initial outreach (cold if unknown, warm if introduced)

2. Phone Call (optional)

3. Meeting Up / Informational Interview *(Make or Break Point)*

    - If they agree to meet for 30 minutes, make sure to set up a calendar invite (with time and address) and share it with them.

    - It should be somewhere close to where they are.

    - You're not expected to buy them anything. Might want to buy your coffee prior to their arrival and set up so you're ready to roll once they get there (pen and paper, no computer).

    - Text or e-mail them what you're wearing so they can find you easily (know what they look like too by finding a photo).

4. Follow Up (Thank and request for additional team introductions)

5. Meeting Other Team Members *(Make or Break Point)*

6. Behavioral Interview *(Make or Break Point)*

7. Technical Interview *(Make or Break Point)*

8. Negotiation

9. Employed

## Other Tips

- Great closer: "Really looking forward to chatting."

- **References**: A teacher (Masha), a co-worker (Melissa, Shawn, Kara, Heidi), and a peer (Daniel, Jerry, or Alex). Make sure to notify them that you'll be using them (ask them if they want to know every time you give their info out, or if they're good with just this notice). Provide e-mail and phone number, if possible.

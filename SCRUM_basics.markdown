# Scrum Basics

## Waterfall Model

Three parts: Design, Build, and Test. These parts were implemented sequentially, and prohibited going back to a previous stage.

This usually involved three separate teams, each tasked with a different stage. Upon completion of their stage, they would generally pass on their work to the next team, including documentation detailing the intended functionality of the software. Unfortunately, as a result, teams were usually very disjointed and failed to communicate effectively, thereby impacting success rates.

Other issues include:

- Because of the poor communication that waterfall ensures, the product does not always meet predefined expectations.

- This model makes it extremely costly to change course in any way, whether it be because of a hidden design flaw or a change in market conditions.

Generally speaking, avoid hand-off situations and insist on collaboration.

## Agile Manifesto (2001, 17 Software Developers)
[Agile Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org)

### This Before That (Order of Values)
- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools

- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation

- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation

- **Responding to change** over following a plan

[Agile Manifest Principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

*As you may have noticed, this can be employed by a team of any size, even one.*

### Variants

Most notable are:

- Scrum

- Lean and Kanban

- Extreme Programming(XP)

Some practices employed by XP include:

- Pair programming

- Code reviews

- Test Driven Development (TDD)

- Unit-testing

## Scrum

**Note Shell**: Team-focused framework for software development

### Who (Roles of Team)

**Product Owner**

- Voice of customer

- Manages backlog (a to-do list based on stakeholder input, which can take the form of user stories)

#### Per Treehouse:
*User Story: A product backlog item constructed to describe the value to the user. User stories define who the user is, what they need, and why they need it.*

- Prioritizes team objectives

- Communicates with organization members and customers

There are also stakeholders, whom, like the Product Owner, have some control over production, like:

- Managers or Leaders

- Clients or Customers

The Product Owner is responsible for communicating with the stakeholders to determine product / priorities.

**Scrum Master**

- Acts as catalyst of team cohesion

- Facilities Scrum

- Helps prevent setbacks and impediments (can be anything from assisting with testing / coding to running errands for team)

- Focuses on keeping things on track during the Sprint (e.g. redirects attention of team if anyone goes astray on non-immediate tasks)

- Responsible for logistics, such as Scrum events management and tool maintenance

- Helps keep scope over project (including Product Owner's demands and expectations) plausible for team

- Primarily serves the team - there to support them, not evaluate them

**Development Team Member**

- Write and test code (they are the software engineers, and bring the most value since they create the product)

- Self-assigned tasks (they choose what to work on so long as its within the scope of the Sprint - everything has equal importance)

- Must confirm that their work adheres to conditions of acceptance for given task

- Checks in with Product Owner regularly for work evaluation and further definition of task

- Work together to determine what the conditions of acceptance are for a given task (i.e. when it's officially done)

- Team members should be able to take on multiple roles. For example, someone who typically does front-end work should be able to contribute to back-end work if necessary (regardless of whether it'll take them longer to complete).

### What and When (a.k.a the "Sprint")

*Sprint is a key differentiating aspect of Scrum, and serves as a basic unit of work. In other words, multiple sprints make up the product development process.*

When a team performs a sprint, they go from committing to an amount of work to a demonstration of their accomplishments (a sprint product).

The team will make multiple sprints in order to release software. The length of a sprint is typically time-boxed, and can range anywhere from a week to a month. The team agrees to completing the sprint within this time-box, and will usually begin the next sprint upon the completion of one. This cycle helps the team develop a cadence.

The team meets at the beginning of a sprint to discuss and agree on how long each item should take and how many items can be taken on for a given sprint. The sprint product should be *designed, built, and tested*, and must meet the teams' definition of done. Further, it should be viable for use for customers or in-house.

#### Per Treehouse:
**Sprint Product**: The outcome of a sprint is “potentially shippable product,” or working software that has the potential to be shipped to the customer.
**Time Box**: Once begun, the team is committed to spending exactly the allotted time on the sprint.
**Cadence**: When team has a consistent sprint length, they develop a rhythm or cadence to their work.

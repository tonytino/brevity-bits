# Three E's and Me

**Spend an hour on each of the things below.**

## External Objectives

### Companies (Professional Development)

- Find companies/industries I want to work for
    - Look at careers section of websites for companies that I want to work for.

- Write a cover letter for a specific company detailing why I want to work for them

- Polish my resume and my LinkedIn

- Find blogs by employees at companies I want to work for and comment/tweet on their blog/tweets

### Community

- Look for meetups and networking events to attend

- Reach out to people at companies I want to work for to set up informational interviews

- Look for Hackathons

- Tweet and Blog (50% of creating content, 50% of responding to content)

## Internal Objectives

### Me (Self)

- Exercise

- Spend time on myself (something I want to do, like play HOTS with Jonathan and Spenser)

- Spend time with my girlfriend

### Coding

- Projects

- Portfolio

- Learning (Code School && Treehouse)


*Look up hacker meetup cupertino, focused on introducing coding school students to hiring companies.*

## Additional Gold

- Write handwritten thank you notes, they're powerful.

- Always get someone's e-mail and remember to reach out to them briefly later the same day.

- Answer Stack Overflow and Treehouse questions

- Contribute to open source projects (look for "good first bug" label [React Example](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/1669)). Check out [Code Triage](http://www.codetriage.com/).

- Comment/Ask questions on posts of thought leaders, like on LinkedIn.

- Apply to jobs that are out of the area for practice interviews (gaming the system for practice and learning). Make sure to ask why they would or wouldn't hire me and what their concerns were.

- Find out the contact information for the head of a department that I want to work for and find a way to get in front of them (whether by e-mail or in-person). Remember, if you have the e-mail address of one person at a company, you have all of them (they all follow the same format, Tracy's advice).

- HACK THE HIRING SYSTEM. Figure out how to get around the meta approach.

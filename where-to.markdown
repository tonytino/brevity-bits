# Alex's Summary

Despite the fact that I had only taken one true Finance course in college, I received a position as an Equity Research Associate. I learned most of what I know on the job and did so quickly in order to take on more responsibilities. I covered the Aerospace and Defense industry and spent my days digging deep into company financials, keeping up on relevant industry activity and relaying my knowledge to our sales team and institutional investors.

In my job, I had the pleasure of meeting numerous high-profile CEOs that worked for truly innovative companies. Their passion inspired me to stop being the person that discussed the cool things companies were doing and start being the person that was actually out there pushing the world forward. I chose web development as my new career path because web applications have the ability to incrementally better the lives of such a large amount of people with little startup capital.

I enrolled in Dev Bootcamp, a 19-week program that turns beginners into full stack web developers, a few months ago and haven't looked back since. In that time, I've learned more technologies than I can count and have a burning desire to learn even more. I'm hoping to find a position where I can put my newly forged skills to the test, while continuing to learn at the feverish pace I have set for myself.

## DBC

Dev Bootcamp is a 19 week intensive program for aspiring web developers. The program takes beginners and turns them into full-stack developers by teaching technologies such as Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS and Git. I graduated from the program in June 2015.

The first 9 weeks of the program are remote, while the second 9 weeks are an immersive on-site experience. The program also focuses heavily on improving emotional intelligence and working in team environments.

While a student at Dev Bootcamp, I lead a final project team in the crafting of a fully decoupled, mobile first application during the last week of the program. As a team lead, I was in charge of delegating responsibilities, creating daily goals, prioritizing features and maintaining a functioning git workflow.

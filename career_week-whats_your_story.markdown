# What's Your Story

*Answer the following in short sentences or bullets.*

## Tell me about yourself in ten seconds *and* in thirty seconds.

*Focus on what got you into this industry and why you want to be part of it.*

### Ten Seconds

**This should be the trimmed version of the thirty second response. This should really pull someone in (think elevator).**

*Personal Scope*
My name is Anthony Hernandez. I have a strong desire to build beautiful and meaningful things, to constantly be learning, to impact others' lives, and to always make the most of every opportunity.

*Career Scope*
My name is Anthony Hernandez. I studied Economics in college, went into Finance for two years, and discovered my love for creating meaningful things out of thin air. After being self-introduced to programming, I quickly realized that I was in the wrong industry and finally understood what it is that I want to do. I took the leap of faith and left my job to become a junior web developer, and cannot wait to start contributing to a team that's shaking the industry.

### Thirty Seconds

**Write this version first. Remember, you want to peak someone's interest, not bore them away (think meetup).**
